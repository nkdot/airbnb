The ultimate goal of this project is to predict the success of a listing in terms of booking status. Web scraped listings in San Francisco and collected more than 50 factors(Reviews, location, host details, past bookings, listing price, etc) and performed exploratory data analysis. Built different models using KNN, CART, Logistic regression, and deep neural network to predict the success rate of a listing. The accuracy of the models was compared. The best model is able to predict the success of a listing with 84% accuracy (f1 score).
